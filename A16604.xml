            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>LEt it not offend thee (good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) that in this Edition I haue varied ſomewhat from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. When J firſt publiſhed this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, I little thought it ſhould haue beene thus often called to the Preſſe, which (as I ſuppoſe) is not ſo much for any ſpeciall worth in it, as for the worthineſſe of the other Treatiſe of the ſame Argument, vnto which it is adioyned; and which, this was a meanes to bring into the light. How-euer, ſeeing by this meanes it comes to paſſe that this of mine falleth into the hands of many, that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe (I aſſure my ſelfe) would neuer haue looked after it, and thoſe ſuch, as (if it had the Authors ſenſe) it would bluſh to looke in the face, being ſo meanly ſet out and furniſhed as it is: I haue deemed it fitting this once to review the ſame, &amp; to ſend it forth in this forme thou ſeeſt; wherein ſome
<pb facs="tcp:16822:5"/> defects in the former are (as I thinke) ſupplied, though not ſo many as either thou or I could wiſh. The old plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe thereof doth ſtill continue, which I eſteeme as no diſgrace therevnto, it being by that meanes fitter for the vſe of plaine and ſimple hearted Chriſtians, for whoſe helpe and direction I firſt publiſhed it.</p>

                     <p>This Sacrament was inſtituted and ordained by Chriſt Ieſus himſelfe. <hi>I haue</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle)
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:16822:9"/> 
                        <hi>receiued of the Lord, that which I haue deliuered vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, v.</hi> 23.</p>
                     <p>As if hee ſhould haue ſaid, if this Sacrament had beene a deuice of mans brain, or a humane tradition, hauing no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ground, but the will &amp; pleaſure of man, your abuſe and profanation thereof had beene the leſſe. But I would haue you to conſider, that this Sacrament was ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and inſtituted by Chriſt Ieſus himſelfe, and that I deliuered this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance vnto you, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe warrant and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from him: And therefore great and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, muſt your ſinne needs be, if you ſhal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane
<pb facs="tcp:16822:10"/> and abuſe the ſame.</p>
                     <p>They cannot bee free from blame, who ſhall contemptuouſly abuſe the ordinances of men, though they require but things indifferent, and meerly vnprofitable; yea, ſuch things, as vnto the fleſh, are burthenſome and hurtful: Much more blameworthy then, muſt they needs be, who ſhall contemne and baſely vſe an immediate ordinance of Chriſt, who neuer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted any thing (which being rightly vſed) is not exceeding profitable &amp; good; yea, whoſe very ordaining of it (though before it was vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or hurtfull) makes it good and profitable, to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:16822:10"/> the worthy vſer thereof, It muſt needes therefore argue, a baſe and light eſtimation of Chriſt and his wiſdome and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, by rude and vnreue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent behauiour, to abuſe any Order, or Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his: And yet, what is more ordinary, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt profeſſed chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, then to make a kinde of May-game, of the principall Ordinances of Chriſt? What palpable contempt is generally offered to the Word, read, &amp; preached, to prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to the Sacraments, Sabbaths, &amp; the Offices of the Miniſtery? How rudely and profanely do many behaue themſelues in the very ſolemne wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb facs="tcp:16822:11"/> of God, ſhewing apparant contempt and ſcorne of the ſame? As though theſe ordinances of Chriſt, were but baſe and ridiculous matters, ſuch as are not to be dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med fit for wiſe men to performe, but in ieſt and ſcorne; or (at the beſt) but as if they were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and counterfaiting fome part vpon a ſtage.</p>
                     <p>But hence wee are to learne; That a ſpeciall meanes to make vs (if wee bee true and ſound hearted Chriſtians,) to ſee what a foule ſin this is, is to conſider throgh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and to meditate ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly of this; That in the receiuing of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wee doe not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:16822:11"/> to the humors, conceits, and pleaſures of men, of Magiſtrates, or Miniſters of Churches, or Fathers; no nor to the meere ordinances of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apoſtles, but to the expreſſe will and Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement of Chriſt. This is in the nature of man, that if they bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned, or commanded any thing, by an inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our that hath no autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, though the thing required bee honeſt and lawfull, yea good &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable; yet, they will ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſcorne to doe it, or doe it in ſcorne. But if one in authority (whom in that reſpect, they reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence) ſhall require the ſame thing, or that which
<pb facs="tcp:16822:12"/> is worſe: they will (if they be not very careleſſe and deſperate) yeeld o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience thereunto, in feare and reuerence.</p>
                     <p>Except therefore, wee ſhould be ſo impious, as to hold that our Sauiour hath no power to re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quire this duty at our hand, or ſo ſhameleſſe &amp; impudent, as to defend, that hee doth no where require it of vs; or ſo blaſphemous, as to ſay, he hath ſhewed no wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome therein; wee muſt needs yeeld, that it muſt needs be a ſhamefull ſin to profane this ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, which is enioyned to bee receiued by ſo awfull and ſoueraigne Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.</p>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:16822:12"/>
                     <p>When therefore men come ſo rudely and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prepared, to the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of theſe holy Rites, as ordinarily they do; it is a ſigne they neuer thinke of that high and ſacred Authoritie, that hath ordained them; but onely conceit and eſteem of them, as of certaine Formalities, which cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome and long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, hath made a faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and which, men are to conforme vnto, more to auoid ſingularity, then for any neceſſitie or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, or out of any dutie that they owe to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutor of them.</p>
                     <p>This then is, and ought to be the maine founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all true reuerence,
<pb facs="tcp:16822:13"/> not onely in the vſe of this, but of al other parts of Gods worſhip. <hi>That Chriſt Ieſus requires this ſeruice at our hands.</hi> And would the Miniſters of Chriſt) who are by their Office to diſpence theſe, and other the like Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Chriſt) haue their miniſtery not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned, but truely reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced, they ſhold make it appeare, (as <hi>Paul</hi> doth heere) that they miniſter no other word, or Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, preſcribe no other worſhip, preach no other doctrine, binde mens conſciences with no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lawes, allure them with no other promiſes, feare them with no other threatnings; then ſuch as

                     <p>That ſeruice and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, required by mans law, framed but by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence from the word, or according to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall rules thereof, is in a holy &amp; religious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to bee performed: Much more ſuch a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, as Chriſt ſo imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately and expreſly in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtituted,

                     <p>Hence we are to learn,</p>

<pb facs="tcp:16822:15"/> yet is ſpiritually, and will bee as effectuall preſent now, as at the firſt inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof.

                     <p n="2">2 It being a great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to this Sacrament, that Chriſt himſelf ſhold in his owne perſon admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter it. All good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ſhould thinke, and eſteeme it as an honour vnto themſelues to bee admitted therevnto, and as a great indignitie and diſgrace, to bee excluded

                     <p n="3">3 The Miniſters of the Word and Sacraments alſo, ſhould hence learn, to take heed how they preſume to adminiſter this Sacrament, to ſuch perſons as they haue cauſe to bee perſwaded, that chriſt himſelf would deny this Sacrament vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; or how they deny it to ſuch, as Chriſt himſelf (if he were in their place) would adminiſter it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.

                     <p>THe time that Chriſt, in his ſpeciall wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, made choice of to inſtitute and adminiſter this Sacrament, was, <hi>In the night in which hee was betrayed, v.</hi> 23.</p>
                     <p>This Circumſtance ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth:</p>
                     <p>That this ſpeciall or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, which at this time he inſtituted for his Church, when hee was preparing himſelf to the greateſt worke of loue, that euer was ſhewed, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to lay downe his life for it muſt needs proceed from his infinite loue &amp;
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:16822:16"/> mercy. Gifts bequeathed by friends vpon their death-beds, vſe much to be eſteemed; and where they are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temned, there the loue of the giuer is thought to bee deſpiſed. If then the loue of Chriſt, ſhewed vnto vs when he was dying; yea, euen ready to be put to death for our ſake, be deare and precious vnto vs: This Sacrament, which at that very time was inſtituted by him, and as a ſpeciall Legacy bequeathed to his Church (for whom he thought not his owne precious bloud too dear) it muſt needes deſerue to be deare and precious to vs, &amp; therfore a horrible indignity offered by vs,
<pb facs="tcp:16822:17"/> to abuſe and profane the ſame.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 This was no time for Chriſt who was infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite in wiſdome, to ſpend in inſtituting needles &amp; vnprofitable ceremonies: The vaineſt men that are (if not deſperatly wicked or diſtempered in their braine) doe not vſe at ſuch a time, to abuſe themſelues about vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; but their thoughts then vſe to bee taken vp, with thoſe maters which moſt neceſſarily concern themſelues, and their friends. Farre then be it from vs, that wee ſhould thinke, that our bleſſed Sauiour, ſhould at this time, finde nothing elſe to doe, but to buſie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:16822:17"/> in laying vpon his Church idle &amp; friuilous obſeruances. If men, how miſerable ſoeuer in their liues paſt, at ſuch times as this, vſe to beſtow the beſt things they haue vpon them they moſt loue; we muſt needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, (or exceedingly diſhonour our Sauiour Chriſt) That this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which at this time he bequeathed vnto all his Churches, as a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Legacy, is of ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable price &amp; value: And therefore, that it muſt needs be intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble inhumanitie, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude, to diſpiſe and abuſe the ſame.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Seeing that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, at this time was
<pb facs="tcp:16822:18"/> vndergoing the greateſt, moſt painefull, and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult work that euer was, or ſhall bee performed; euen to offer vp himſelfe a ſacrifice for his church, the zeale of which work had now, more then euer eaten him vp, and capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uated all the thoughts &amp; affections of his ſoule: ſo as it was not poſſible for him at this time to think of any thing elſe, but what might further this worke of our Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the ſaluation of our ſoules. Wee muſt needs conclude, that this Sacrament, being at this time, ſo deliberately both inſtituted and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred, muſt needes tend (after a ſpecial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner)
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:16822:18"/> to the furtherance of our ſaluation, and to make the worke of our Redemption effectuall vnto vs. So that, to ſet light by this Sacrament, is to diſpiſe the great worke of our Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the ſaluation of our ſoules, purchaſed by the bloud of Chriſt.</p>

                     <p>This Bleſſing, was an earneſt and effectuall cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vpon God his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, That he would bee pleaſed to make this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, (being duly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred and receiued) fruitfull and effectuall to thoſe holy &amp; ſauing ends and vſes, for which they were ordained.</p>

                     <p>For the better vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the parts of this Sacrament, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is to bee premiſed of a Sacrament in general</p>
                     <p>This word <hi>(Sacrament)</hi> was wont to ſignifie that ſolemne oath, which the Romane Souldiers were wont to take, whereby they bound themſelues, to performe faithfull ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice to the Emperour in his warres; whence the Latine Diuines haue bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed it, and now by cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome it be come (in theſe Weſtern Churches) a proper name, whereby thoſe outward badges, and Enſignes of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity (<hi>viz.</hi> Baptiſme and the Lords Supper), are vſually called: becauſe
<pb facs="tcp:16822:22"/> that Chriſtians in the due receiuing of them, doe after a ſpeciall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner binde themſelues, (as it were by ſolemne vowes and oathes) to do their Lord and Maſter Ieſus Chriſt faithful ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice in his wars, againſt the world, the fleſh, and the diuell.</p>
                     <p>More eſpecially, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are myſticall Rites and Ceremonies, ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Chriſt, to ſhadow &amp; confirm to his church, the Couenant of Grace, or myſtery of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>Myſticall Rites and Ceremonies, are certain outward bodily ſenſible ſignes inſtituted, to ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow and repreſent in a
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:16822:22"/> ſecret and artificial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, things ſpirituall and internall.</p>
                     <p>In euery Sacrament therefore, there are two things to be conſidered.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 <hi>The outward bodily Signe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2 <hi>The ſpirituall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which is myſtically ſhaddowed and ſet forth by that Signe, and yet after a ſort hidden and locked vp in the ſame.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Apoſtle expreſſeth both theſe.</p>
                     <p>The ſignes are:</p>
                     <p n="1">1 <hi>Certaine outward Elements.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2 <hi>Certaine myſticall Actions, in and about the Elements.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Elements are Bread &amp; Wine. <hi>He tooke Bread,
<pb facs="tcp:16822:23"/> v.</hi> 23. <hi>After the ſame manner alſo hee tooke the Cup, v.</hi> 25. Wine is not expreſſed heere, but it is implied, and the fruit of the vine is expreſly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by our Sauiour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. <hi>Mar.</hi> 14.</p>
                     <p>The Actions in and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Elements are,</p>
                     <p n="1">1 <hi>Breaking and eating of Bread.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2 <hi>Drinking of Wine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe ſignes conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in themſelues, are not of ſuch force, to ſtir vp any great reuerence in the receiuing of them: there being no one thing more common in the world, then eating of bread, and drinking of wine; yet there is no iuſt cauſe why, in regard of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:16822:23"/> the commonnes of them, that this ſacrament ſhold be deſpiſed, they being matters in themſelues, both profitable &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable. If Chriſt had not only ordained bread in generall, for this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, but the baſeſt &amp; hardeſt kind of bread that could bee, ſuch as is made of pulſe, or bran, or acornes: if in ſtead of wine, hee had appointed vs in this action, vinegar mingled with gall to drinke, ſuch as himſelfe (for our ſakes) was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to taſte of; it would beſeeme the daintieſt, &amp; moſt queaſie ſtomacke, (that lookes to be ſaued by him) to receiue the ſame thankfully, reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently,
<pb facs="tcp:16822:24"/> and religiouſly. If he had required of vs, in ſtead of eating bread, and drinking wine, ſome ſeruice as painefull (and in it ſelfe ſhamefull) as Circumciſion, it had bin our duty, to haue accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it (as the Iewes did) our honour to performe the ſame. It is then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable inſolency, to thinke it a baſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible thing, vpon Chriſts ſpeciall pleaſure, to eat bread, and drinke wine at his Table, to that end for which hee hath the ſame.</p>
                     <p>There are many things, that in themſelues are of no honour or reſpect, that in regard of ſome ſpeciall vſe and applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:16822:24"/> are matters of great honor, as the white Wand carried before the Iudge; the Cap of Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, worne before the Lord Maior; the ſword borne before the King. Though therefore, theſe outward ſignes, be in themſelues but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon matters; yet in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of that ſpeciall my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery that is in them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing applyed to that vſe, vnto which they are in this Sacrament, and that by Chriſts owne ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, they muſt needes be both an honour to Chriſt, and honourable to the due vſer of them.</p>
                     <p>In that this eating of bread, and drinking of wine here required, was
<pb facs="tcp:16822:25"/> at the firſt inſtitution done <hi>after Supper,</hi> as the Apoſtle noteth: It ſheweth that this bread and wine, and this eating and drinking, hath more then an ordinary vſe or end: <hi>viz.</hi> That we are to eat this bread, and to drinke this wine, not ſo much to ſatisfie hunger and quench thirſt, or to nouriſh our bodies, &amp; reuiue and refreſh our vitall ſpirits; for then our Sauiour would not haue adminiſtred it immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly after ſupper, and that a feſtiuall ſupper, when they (who were to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it at his hands) were filled before with bread and wine. But we muſt looke heerein, to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:16822:25"/> another more high and ſpeciall vſe, vnto which it pleaſeth the wiſdome and goodneſſe of Chriſt in this action, to aduance theſe common and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary things. So that in this bread and wine, wee muſt looke after bread &amp; wine of another &amp; high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er nature; ſuch whereby our ſoules are to be nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed and refreſhed to euerlaſting life.</p>

                     <p>The <hi>breaking of the bread</hi> ſignifieth, the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Chriſts body, that is, all the vnſpeakable torments that hee ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in his humane nature for our ſins; which were greater, then if his liuing Body, had been rent and torne into a thouſand pieces, and all his bones broken and beaten to powder.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The eating of this bread, and drinking this wine</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth, that ſpeciall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit (which the Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of this Sacrament ſhall reap by the death and ſufferings of Chriſt, if by a liuely faith he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply

                     <p>As though he ſhould haue ſaid;</p>
                     <p>This bread, ſo broken as you ſee, ſhall bee a ſigne &amp; token vnto you, &amp; vnto al others that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
<pb facs="tcp:16822:27"/> in my Name, of that which I haue done, and ſuffered in my fleſh for you. This wine, more eſpecially, ſhal be a ſigne euen of that blood, which hanging vpon the Croſſe I ſhed, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe the pardon and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of your ſinnes; which is not ſuch bloud, as was offered in the old Teſtament; <hi>viz.</hi> The bloud of Oxen, Goates, and Sheepe: but is in very deed, the bloud of God and man, whereby the New Teſtament is ſealed &amp; ratified, which offereth ſaluation to all them who ſhall repent and beleeue in mee, and rely vpon the merits of this my bloudy paſſion.</p>
                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:16822:27"/>
                     <p>Therefore, take and eate, this myſtical bread, and drinke this wine, &amp; and let them be as ſeales and pledges vnto you, &amp; vnto all others (who ſhal worthily receiue the ſame; That as verily, as w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> your bodily mouthes you eate this bread, and drinke this wine, and are comforted and refreſhed by them; ſo verily ſhall your ſoules taſte of, and by the mouth of Faith, feed vpon, and be refre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with my Body and Bloud; yea, in and by the eating of this bread, and the drinking of this wine (as you ought to do) you ſhall ſpiritually eat and drink my Body &amp; Bloud: That is, the merits of my
<pb facs="tcp:16822:28"/> Paſſion ſhall (by meanes therof) be ſo effectually applied vnto you, that thereby (as it were by daily food) you ſhall liue euerlaſtingly. So that, that which you eat and drinke in this Sacrament, is not onely bread and wine, but after a ſort, my Body and bloud, which was ſacrificed for you.</p>
                     <p>Is not then this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a myſtery to bee trembled at? Is it not a brutiſh ſin, without any preparation to ruſh vpon the ſame? If wee did but eat and drinke ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for bodily neceſſitie, or pleaſure; it were bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh to runne vnto the ſame, as a horſe to the maunger, or a ſwine to the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:16822:28"/> trough, not lifting our hearts (at the leaſt) to God in thankfulneſſe for them. How much more brutiſh is it, to eat this bread, and drinke this wine, without due reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and regard of ſo high and heauenly a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery? It were an indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie offered to the great worke of our Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but occaſionally to thinke or ſpeake thereof without reuerence: But to be irreuerently affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted then, when by ſuch a ſpecial ordinance it is ſo effectually repreſented &amp; applyed vnto vs, muſt needs be a dreadfull and damnable ſinne.</p>
                     <p>For the further confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation whereof, let vs
<pb facs="tcp:16822:29"/> conſider ſome ſpeciall inſtructions, from the particulars, in regard of the ſpeciall analogy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the ſignes and the things ſignified.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 In that our Sauiour repreſents his Body, in this Sacrament by bread; he teacheth vs thereby, that his Body, is to the ſoule of man, as bread is to the body. Bread is the very ſtaffe of a mans bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily life, the moſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall food of poore and rich; that which of all other food can leaſt bee ſpared; that which in hun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ger, men firſt and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally deſire: that the ſcar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>citie whereof makes fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine; that which if it be plentifully, vſuall makes
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:16822:29"/> all other neceſſaries of this life plentifull; that which we daily feed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; that which men ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally take greateſt paines for. Hence our Sauiour in the Lords Praier, teaching to craue all the needfull co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forts in this life, comprehends all vnder <hi>daily bread.</hi> And therefore by like propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, his Body in that manner, that it is heere meant and propounded, is the very ſtaffe and ſtay of a Chriſtian life. That without which, neither poore nor rich, high nor low, ſhall liue eternally. That which, without all other meanes, can feed &amp; nouriſh a man to euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life; and which of
<pb facs="tcp:16822:30"/> all other meanes cannot be ſpared: That which uery true chriſtian ſoule, firſt and principally hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greth after: That, the want whereof only, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſheth and ſtarues the ſoule. That which they will take the greateſt paines and toyle to get; and which without the greateſt paine and trauel cannot be gotten. That which they will deſire to feed vpon euery day, and euery meale, relliſhing nothing elſe without it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 In that the bread is broken, to ſignifie his Body broken for vs, it teacheth vs: that it is not ſimply the Body of Chriſt by which we are to be fed, but his <hi>Body
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:16822:30"/> broken:</hi> that is, That which Chriſt did, &amp; ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for vs, eſpecially vpon the Croſſe. For (to ſpeake properly) his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was not broken. It is not therefore properly, Chriſt glorified in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, or Chriſt ſimply God, or God and man, which is the bread, that a Chriſtian ſoule, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for ſinne, can digeſt or reliſh; but Chriſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, Chriſt hanging vpon the Croſſe. It is Chriſts death, that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the life of a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. It is Chriſt and his Croſſe both together, that is the bread of life: yea not the Croſſe only, but the Thornes alſo wherewith he was crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<pb facs="tcp:16822:31"/> the whippes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with hee was ſcourged, the nailes with which he was faſtned, the vineger and gall which he taſted, yea, and <hi>Iudas</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traied him, &amp; <hi>Pilate</hi> that condemned him, and the Scribes &amp; Phariſees, that proſecuted againſt him, and all the people which cried, crucifie him. Chriſt conſidered with al theſe, is that ſpirituall bread, that is typed by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall. And without theſe, hee cannot bee the bread of life to a ſinfull ſoule. So that, if there be any Tranſubſtantiation in this Sacrament, either the bread is turned into all theſe, or all theſe into the bread.</p>
                     <pb n="27" facs="tcp:16822:31"/>
                     <p n="3">3 The vſe of wine, is well knowne, it doth not onely (as water) quench the thirſt, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo exceedingly comfort the heart, and refreſh the ſpirits. Seeing then it is the pleaſure of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our in this Sacrament, to make wine the type of his bloud: It teacheth vs, what effects Chriſts bloud, and the ſhedding thereof ſhall haue in the ſoules of all true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and worthy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants. Their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall thirſt after righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe and ſaluation, ſhall be quenched. In the midſt of all the horrors and terrors of death and hell, they ſhal by meanes thereof, bee ſolaced and
<pb facs="tcp:16822:32"/> comforted. This bloud, ſtreaming from the ſides of Chriſt, ſhall in the midſt of their ſorrowes &amp; griefes, and troubles, and vexations, bee as a cup of the excellenteſt wine, to cheere them, &amp; reuiue their ſpirits, and to inflame their zeale. This wine hath that effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſie and force in it, that it will turne all the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter potions (that Gods children vſe to drinke) into wine. The Apoſtles of our Sauior, when they were drinking deepely of the whippe, this wine mingled with that bitter potion, turned it alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to wine: inſomuch as they reioyced, that they were counted worthy to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:16822:32"/> ſuffer that which they did, for Chriſts ſake.</p>
                     <p>That Religion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, which lockes from the people, the wine in this Sacrament, doth therein alſo as much, as lies in it, keep from them alſo that wine, which is typed and ſhaddowed thereby, euen the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous bloud of Ieſus Chriſt, the onely wine that can refreſh and comfort the ſoule of an afflicted ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, which is enough to argue the ſame to be An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian, if there were nothing elſe. And the more Antichriſtian, the more it maintaineth that the wine in this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is the very reall bloud of Chriſt. What is
<pb facs="tcp:16822:33"/> this but to teach, that the true bloud of Chriſt belongs not to them, that if they wil be ſaued, they muſt bee ſaued by ſome other meanes; or onely by gazing vpon, and adoring the painted bloud of ſome painted or carued Crucifix.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 This conſecrated bread and wine, muſt alſo (by the precept of our Sauiour) bee eaten and drunken; &amp; thereby we are taught: That thoſe onely ſhal liue eternally, by the vertue of Chriſts Body and Bloud, which feed vpon the ſame, as mens bodies feed vpon bread and wine. For as bread and wine (if they be onely looked vpon, &amp;
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:16822:33"/> not taken and receiued into the ſtomacke) can-feed, nouriſh, or refreſh the body of man, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue life in the ſame: No more ſhall the Body &amp; bloud of Chriſt, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and refreſh the ſoule of a ſinner, or be a means of ſpirituall and euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting life vnto him, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they bee receiued &amp; ſpiritually applied to the ſoule, as bread and wine are to the body, when they are eaten and drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. Thoſe therfore, who are the redeemed of Chriſt, muſt be knit and vnited to Chriſt, and one with him, as the bread that nouriſheth, and the wine that refreſheth the body, is turned into our
<pb facs="tcp:16822:34"/> fleſh, and made one with it. This Sacrament then, which ſealeth ſo great a myſtery as this is, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be profaned without great indignity to the myſtery it ſelfe.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 In that Chriſt ſaith, that that which they take and eat, it is his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and that which they drinke, it is his bloud, he teacheth vs. That this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament doth not onely, (as in a Table) picture &amp; repreſent what Chriſt hath ſuffered for ſinners; but which is a thouſand times more, it is by the dinance of Chriſt (to the worthy Receiuer) a bleſſed inſtrument; by meanes whereof, Chriſt Ieſus and his merits, are
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:16822:34"/> applied and made effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall to their ſoules. So that ſuch is the vnion of the thing ſignified, and the ſigne, that in and throgh the eating of this bread, and drinking this wine, the ſoule of the worthy Receiuer, doth ſpiritually and by faith, eat the Body and drinke the bloud of Ieſus Chriſt, and alwaies find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſuch ſtrength, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and life therein, as the body findes ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in the eating of bread and drinking of wine. So that this bread and this wine, are not onely na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſignes of Chriſt Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and bloud, as the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and Iuybuſh are of wine, which onely ſhew
<pb facs="tcp:16822:35"/> that there is wine there to bee bought, but doe not exhibite it: But the Body of Chriſt is in ſuch a manner in this ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall bread, and the bloud in this wine, that in the eating of the one, the worthy Receiuer eats the other, &amp; in drinking the one, drinkes the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Can there then a greater myſtery be deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by man, in and about which hee ought to bee reuerently conuerſant, &amp; religiouſly and holily af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected: And is it not a brutiſh ſinne, to behaue our ſelues vnworthily in ſuch an action?</p>
                     <p>Let vs not heere paſſe by, but once againe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into conſideration, of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:16822:35"/> that execrable Religion of the Church of Rome, which keepeth ſuch a Cup, filled with ſuch wine (without any co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour in the world) from the people. They ſay, that the bloud of Chriſt, is in the body of Chriſt; and therefore the people in receiuing the one, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue therein the other. But this is an Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian foppery: how can thoſe be together, that Chriſt hath ſo directly put aſunder, the one in a loafe, the other in a Cup? How can the bloud be in a body broken, and pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced? How can that bloud be in the body, which is ſhed out of the body? What bloud of Chriſt
<pb facs="tcp:16822:36"/> can comfort a Chriſtian ſoule, but that which was ſhed? or what bloud is offered in this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but that which was ſhed? and though it were in the body, as it is recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in this Sacrament: yet it being Chriſts wil, his bloud ſhould not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be eaten, but drunken; what a ſacriligious lewd<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes is this, where Chriſt eſpecially, and by name, requires the drinking of his bloud, that they ſhould deny the people that, and make them take vp, with the eating of it onely? And how doth it appeare, that the bloud, as it is eaten, is any part of the Sacrament, and if not, what benefit comes
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:16822:36"/> to the Receiuer thereby, in that regard? iuſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. It is the drinking, and not the eating of Chriſts bloud in this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, that muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh the ſoule of the Communicant: &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this drinking therof, the ſoule can no more be refreſhed with the bloud of Chriſt, in this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then the bodily thirſt can bee quenched, by that water that is in bread. And a man, in ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Body of Chriſt broken, crucified, pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with a ſpeare, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed; ſo as it is exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited to a Chriſtian, in this Sacrament, can no more be ſaid, in &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to drinke the bloud of
<pb facs="tcp:16822:37"/> Chriſt, then the Iewes that did eat the fleſh of ſheepe and oxen, offered in ſacrifice, after that the bloud was ſeparated, and the parcels were roſted and broyled, could bee ſaid then, and therein to drink the bloud of ſheep &amp; oxen. And they might as well proue that wine was in the bread, before the conſecration, as that the bloud of Chriſt, is in the body after the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration.</p>

                     <p>That which reſpecteth our ſelues, is, That wee receiue this Sacrament, to ſolemnize thereby a ſpeciall memoriall of Chriſt, and of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption by him. <hi>This doe</hi> (ſaith our Sauiour) <hi>in remembrance of me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>One End then, why this Sacrament is to bee vſed, and the vſe to bee continued in the Church of Chriſt, is, That in and by the due receiuing thereof, wee might the
<pb facs="tcp:16822:38"/> more feelingly and effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually remember, what our Sauiour hath done and ſuffered for vs.</p>
                     <p>When our ſpeciall friends, vpon their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from vs, doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow vpon vs any token of remembrance, they do it not onely for that ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall good that comes to vs, by the ordinary vſe of the thing it ſelfe; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that thereby, ſo often as wee looke vpon the ſame, or vſe it, we ſhould moreouer make this vſe of it, to call to minde thereby, the many loues and fauours they haue ſhewed vnto vs. And this is written in our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that when any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion is but offered vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:16822:38"/> vs, of remembring a deare friend departed from vs, to be more then ordinarily affected there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. Hence ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſons, ſo heartily (vpon any occaſion of remembrance) pray the Lord to haue mercy on their ſoules that are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted this life, whom they loue and haue been bound vnto: but when they behold any ſpeciall memoriall and token of their loue, then they are often (for the time) tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported &amp; rauiſhed with extraordinary affection, which they will ſhew euen to the token of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance it ſelf, doing a kinde of honour vnto it. Seeing therefore, this
<pb facs="tcp:16822:39"/> Sacrament, that is not only left vnto vs, by the greateſt friend that euer we had, but left of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to bee a ſpeciall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance and pledge, of the greateſt loue that euer was ſhewed to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall creatures, and which hath the very effects and fruits of loue written vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, yea ingrauen in it; yea, in ſome ſort contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in it; Is it not incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, that any that loue &amp; beleeue in Ieſus Chriſt, ſhould lightly regard &amp; vnworthily abuſe this Sacrament?</p>
                     <p>But heere by the way, wee may obſerue how ſtrangely forgetfull, euen the faithfull are, of the vnſpeakeable loue of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:16822:39"/> Chriſt, that they ſhould ſtand in need of ſuch a Remembrance: For vnto them is this Sacrament giuen, as a helpe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto. Is it poſſible that a man ſhould be forgetfull of ſuch a Maſter, as hath with a great price redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Gallies? Yea, who for to redeeme him, hath made himſelfe a ſlaue; yea, who was content to purchaſe his ſeruants freedome, with his owne death? Is it poſſible, ſuch a ſeruant ſhould need any ſpeciall remembrance? would not one thinke he ſhould rather need ſom means to make him forget his loue. Yet this is the ſtrange diſpoſition of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
<pb facs="tcp:16822:40"/> euen of the beſt: that though our conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was a thouſand times more miſerable, then the condition of a Turkes Gally-ſlaue can bee: Though chriſt Ieſus hath done ten thouſand times more for our freedome therefrom, then is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for any one man to doe for another: though whatſoeuer wee enioy, we haue it from his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and loue: our ſoules, bodies, ſenſes, wit, beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, wealth, life; ſo as all our ſenſes are ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed about, with me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morialls of his loue, that wee can ſee, heare, feele, nor taſte any thing; but it may put vs in minde of his loue; yea, of his death
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:16822:40"/> and paſſion, by which the free vſe of theſe things haue beene pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed vnto vs; yet for all this, you ſee we ſtand in need of a more ſpecial remembrance: Yea, and yet (ſinfull wretches that we are) we are ready to abuſe theſe Remembran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; And (which excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth wonder) wee are prone, in the midſt of them, moſt of all to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get Chriſt and his loue towards vs, and then, and therein readieſt to diſhonour him.</p>
                     <p>Wee may hence fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther note.</p>
                     <p>That Chriſt our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, takes it moſt kindly when we remember and thinke vpon him, &amp; that
<pb facs="tcp:16822:41"/> which hee hath done for vs.</p>
                     <p>The inſtitution of this Sacrament, to this end ſhewes hee much affects and deſires it. And the more he affects, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in our remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of him; the more vnkindly and offenſiuely hee will take our forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of him.</p>
                     <p>Hence alſo it appeares, that then we ſpecially eat the fleſh of chriſt, &amp; drink his bloud, when with a beleeuing heart &amp; mind, we effectually remember, &amp; in our remembrance, we ſeriouſly meditate of, &amp; in our meditation are religiouſly affected, and in our affections through<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly inflamed with the loue
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:16822:41"/> of Chriſt, grounded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that which Chriſt hath done for vs, and which is repreſented and ſealed vnto vs in this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</p>

                     <p>Therefore in our due receiuing of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we doe (as it were) lead men by the hand, into the Garden of <hi>Geth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemane,</hi> and there ſhew them Chriſt in extreame horror, ſweating bloud, <hi>Iudas</hi> traiterouſly kiſſing him, the Souldiers bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him and leading him to iudgement. We lead him to <hi>Caiphas</hi> Hall, and <hi>Pilates</hi> Throne; &amp; there ſhew them Chriſt, moſt vniuſtly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned, moſt contumeliouſly buffetted
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:16822:42"/> and ſpet vpon, ſcourged &amp; crowned with thorns, ſcorned and derided.

                     <p>Can we in this myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſee &amp; behold all this? ſhall wee (aftet a ſort) heereby point it out vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to others, and ſhall wee

                     <p>By this it appeares, how forcible the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the Sacrament is, to terrifie all Chriſtians from the profanation thereof, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the fitting and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring of them to the worthy receiuing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
                     <p>Where (to conclude) note that the Apoſtle in al the former points, hath propounded nothing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth, but what they could not be ignorant of before; which practiſe of the Apoſtle teacheth vs,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:16822:43"/> of what neceſſitie conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall teaching is in the Church of Chriſt, when Miniſters muſt be faine, not onely to inſtruct the people of God in thoſe points of doctrine that they are ignorant of: but often alſo call to their minde &amp; conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, thoſe points which they know already well enough, vpon ſuch par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular occaſions as they are to make ſpeciall vſe of them. And verily, though men could ſay all the Scriptures by heart, though they could vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand euery hard and difficult place thereof; though they knew al the grounds and principles of the Chriſtian Faith;
<pb facs="tcp:16822:44"/> though they were able to anſwere all oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt any diuine truth: yet for all this, there would be vſe both of reading the Word, &amp; preaching alſo in the Church of God.</p>
                     <p>For let our knowledge bee neuer ſo great, yet if wee bee not often put in mind of it: if we be not taught how in ſuch and ſuch particular caſes to apply it; if by the power of Chriſts Ordinance, it be not beaten out of our head, into our heart, it will bee as a dead letter vnto vs, yea, and moſt out of our head, when wee ſhould moſt vſe it.

To bee guiltie of any bloud, (though of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and ſinfull bloud) hath bin a burthen, that hath made the ſtouteſt heart to ake and grone vnder it. But who is able, (when his conſcience ſhall once be awaked) to beare the guilt of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent bloud? And if the bloud of innocent <hi>Abel,</hi> did lie ſo heauy vpon <hi>Cain, Gen.</hi> 4.13. How heauy ſhall the bloud of the innocent Lambe of

                     <p>The fourth is Senſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie; when men ſo ſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate and pamper them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues with the delight &amp; pleaſures of the world, and the fleſh, as they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, nor care not to taſte of things ſpirituall. And therefore they bring no other hearts, nor affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons vnto this Sacrament, then vnto ordinary meat and drinke; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times worſe.</p>
                     <p>The 5. is Careleſnes &amp; ſecuritie; which is, when we come with ſuch affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and diſpoſitions, vnto this Sacrament, as to a matter, that we nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther looke to receiue any good by, or feare to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue any hurt by.

                     <p>The ſixth is Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; when we neuer care in what manner wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue; and yet preſume to receiue (as much fruit and benefit by the Sacrament) as thoſe who are moſt carefull to fit and prepare themſelues therevnto.</p>
                     <p>The ſeuenth is Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitablenes; when our ſoules are ſo full of bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hatred and malice to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our neighbour, &amp; by meanes therof ſo vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and diſquieted, with diuelliſh perturbations, that they cannot receiue, or taſte the ſweet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts repreſented and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered

                     <p>The 8. is Temporizing; w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is, when the only, or main ground, for w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> we come to receiue this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, is; The faſhion &amp; cuſtome of the times and places in which wee liue. And (when without any further examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) we thinke wee haue done enough, if we haue (in that outward forme and manner) receiued that others doe.</p>
                     <p>The ninth is Inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, or an vnſtaied and wandring minde; when either we conſider not what wee are about, or haue our thoughts (during that action) bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied about other matters.</p>
                     <p>The tenth is Profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;

                     <p>Other meanes and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes there are of this ſin; but the conſideration of theſe may ſuffice.

                        <hi>CHAP. XII.</hi> Of the ground, why vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Receiuers are guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Body and Bloud of Chriſt.</head>
                     <p>THe ground and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why thoſe who receiue vnworthily, are guilty of the Body and bloud of Chriſt, may be gathered from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Doctrine of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. For from that doth the Apoſtle inferre and conclude the ſame.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Such perſons in ſo doing, doe plainely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe the ſacred authority of Chriſt, the Inſtitutor &amp; firſt Adminiſter here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Now they that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe the authority of
<pb facs="tcp:16822:52"/> Chriſt, doe therein (in ſome ſort) diſpiſe the Perſon of Chriſt, and his ſufferings, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent ſhew contempt vnto his Body &amp; bloud; by which principally his authority is ratified and confirmed. And to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe the Perſon, ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, Body and bloud of Chriſt; what is it (but in ſome ſort) to aſſent vnto, &amp; therein to ioyne with them that crucified him, and ſhed his bloud.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 They contemne a ſpecial token of his loue, a ſpeciall memoriall of his Body and bloud, a ſpeciall inſtrument, by means wherof, his Body &amp; bloud is applyed vnto them. What is this but
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:16822:52"/> to offer an indignity, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his ſacred Body and bloud?</p>
                     <p n="3">3 They offer heerein contempt, to the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall Cognizances &amp; En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes of Chriſtianitie, to a ſpeciall coine and pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Chriſt crucified.</p>
                     <p>The like wrong offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Enſignes and picture of a Prince, is worthily iudged to bee offered to the Prince himſelfe; Yea, foraſmuch as in this Sacrament, the very Body and bloud of Chriſt, and all the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits depending therevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are ſpiritually offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto the Receiuer, as lands are offered &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaied to men, by the ſealing and deliuering of
<pb facs="tcp:16822:53"/> Deeds and Indentures; he that ſhall vnworthily behaue himſelfe, in the receiuing of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhall therein as much deſpiſe the Body &amp; bloud of Chriſt, as hee may bee ſaid to deſpiſe, the gift of lands, which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temneth the writings, Seales, and Indentures, whereby they vſe to bee conuaied, ſecured, and confirmed.</p>
                     <p>Hence from this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent we may note.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 That Chriſt receiues damnable indignitie, and contumely ſometimes; not from Iewes and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels onely: but often from Chriſtians, ſuch as looke to be ſaued by his bloud-ſhedding, &amp; that
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:16822:53"/> when they are perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming ſpeciall worſhip &amp; ſeruice vnto him. For what greater wrong can there be, then to be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of that bloud, which was ſhed to redeeme vs? which was the ſinne of this Church, and is the ſinne of all ſuch Perſons, as are vnworthy recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of this Sacrament.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 The bare confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie vnto the outward exerciſes of Religion, whether Word, Prayer, or Sacraments, is not enough to make vs good Chriſtians; but we may be the worſe Chriſtians for this, <hi>Romans</hi> 2.28. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.1-7. Many ignorant and ſeduced ſoules, thinke they are
<pb facs="tcp:16822:54"/> Chriſtians good enough, if their foreheads haue been ſprinkled, with the water of Baptiſme; if ſomtimes they heare the Word, and receiue the outward elements of this Sacrament. But they may doe all theſe in ſuch a manner, that by doing of them, they may crucifie Chriſt, and trample his bloud vnder their feet. It were better for vs, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to receiue this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then in and by the very act thereof, to pull vpon our heads the guilt of Chriſts body and bloud.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Note the different and contrary effect, of this Sacrament in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuers thereof. It is the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:16822:54"/> ſauour of death vnto death, to ſome; to other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, the ſauour of life vnto life. The worthy Receiuer is fed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed, and nouriſhed, by the Body and bloud of Chriſt receiued there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. Contrarily, the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Receiuer, is pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted &amp; defiled thereby; &amp; the oftner he receiues it, the more hee receiues therein, the bane &amp; poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his owne ſoule. Thoſe therefore, which in ſuch a manner, receiue the Body and bloud of Chriſt, and looke for Grace thereby, are ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in as fond, as if they that whipt Chriſt, and nailed him on the Croſſe, and by meanes thereof, had
<pb facs="tcp:16822:55"/> their faces, hands, and garments, beſprinkled with his bloud, ſhould thinke by that meanes to be purged &amp; freed from their ſinnes. Or as if hee (who pierced chriſts ſide with a Speare) ſhould haue held a cup at the wound, and filled it, and drunke it off, and haue fancied by that meanes, to drinke the bloud of Chriſt, to the health and eternall ſaluation of his owne ſoule. And thus much of the firſt Part of Preparation.</p>
                     <p>Wherein wee haue been plainely taught, by the Apoſtle, what a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous ſinne it is, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe this holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. God grant, that
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:16822:55"/> the conſideration hereof may deepely affects vs; that wee may with feare &amp; trembling, take heed what hands wee lay vpon ſo holy Myſteries, <hi>Amen.</hi>

                     <p>THe triall and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of our ſelues in general here required, is a diligent ſearch and
<pb facs="tcp:16822:60"/> inquiſition to bee made, within our ſoules and conſciences, whether we bee ſuch kind of perſons as may be aſſured, that the Lord will bid wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to this Table.</p>
                     <p>And this triall is not to be ſleight &amp; curſory, but moſt ſtrict and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; ſuch as gold Smiths vſe, when not onely by touch, but by fier &amp; ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer they try whether their Gold and Siluer be pure or no. For ſuch a manner of triall the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles word ſignifieth.</p>
                     <p>The Lord cannot bid any welcome to his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but ſuch as he is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually reconciled vnto; and whoſe perſons are acceptable and wel plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:16822:60"/> vnto him.</p>
                     <p>They who are ſuch perſons, haue certaine ſpeciall gifts and graces beſtowed vpon them, from which they may conclude infallibly, that God doth loue and fauor them: which for diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſake, from other common gifts are called, <hi>Sauing Graces.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Herein then wee muſt labour to ſearch out in our ſelues, theſe Graces; and to try whether they bee in vs or no. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we come to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars; hence we may note in generall,</p>
                     <p n="1">1 That Gods ſpeciall ſauing graces may bee in vs, and yet not alwayes apparant vnto vs; but
<pb facs="tcp:16822:61"/> may ſometimes lie hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in the ſoule, vntill by ſome ſpeciall ſearch they be diſcouered; elſe ſuch trials as theſe ſhold be needleſſe. As therfore it is matter of humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to all good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that vpon due triall, they finde more corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in themſelues, then did before appeare vnto them: So this may bee a ſpeciall comfort, that there are alſo in them (which by diligent triall they ſhall finde) greater graces then euer they imagined to be in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. This therefore ſhould incourage vs, to ſearch ourſelues ſo much the more narrowly: for if we ſhall (by a carefull
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:16822:61"/> ſearch) find in our ſoules, but any one grace, or but any degree of a grace, more then wee did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue before; it wil bring more ſound comfort and ioy vnto our hearts, then if wee had found a hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den treaſure of ſiluer or gold.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 By this it appeares, that a man (if ſo be hee will carefully vſe the meanes) may come to ſome certain knowledge and inſight of the ſauing gifts and graces of God, which are in his owne ſoule: And therefore it muſt needes bee a great fault in him, to bee care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe in vſing the meanes. It is a ſigne hee ſets no price vpon Gods graces,
<pb facs="tcp:16822:62"/> that makes no inquiry, whether he hath them in his poſſeſſion or no. Men vſe to make diligent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, after hidden and concealed lands and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; much more ought we to ſearch out the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed graces of God, which lie hid in our own ſoules; and which wee cannot imploy (as wee ought) ſo long as wee know not whether they be in vs or no.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 It is in this reſpect, very beneficiall and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for vs, to finde out &amp; know, what gifts God hath beſtowed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vs, in that (as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares by this place) it is a meanes, not onely to preuent fearfull and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:16822:62"/> ſinnes, but to make vs more capable of greater graces, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe ſhall bee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held and detained from vs. For wee haue no grounded hope to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue any new grace, or bleſſing, from any ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God, vntill by a diligent ſearch of our ſelues, we haue firſt found ſome former grace in our ſelues, that may make vs (in ſom degree) fit and worthy receiuers thereof. For to him that hath (ſaith our Sauiour) ſhall be giuen, and from him that hath not, ſhall be taken away, euen that which he hath. The vſe of one grace, is to fit and prepare vs for the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb facs="tcp:16822:63"/> of an other.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe ſpeciall gifts &amp; graces which are in all them whoſe perſons are acceptable to God, are <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By Faith wee are to vnderſtand a true, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and iuſtifying faith, which is a ſupernaturall gift of God, whereby a man (ſeeing the vileneſſe of his ſinne) relieth only vpon the merits of Chriſt Ieſus, for the pardon thereof.</p>
                     <p>From this Faith, doe al other Chriſtian graces proceed, and according to the growth of it doe they grow. Whatſoeuer is done by vertue of this Faith (how ſimple ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the Action may ſeem
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:16822:63"/> to bee) it is pleaſing to God: Otherwiſe (how glorious ſoeuer) it is odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to him. This grace entitles vs to Chriſt and all his merits. This effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually applyeth them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs: This is the onely mouth, by which the Body and bloud of the Lord is eaten and drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; and therefore a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall argument of Gods fauour, and a neceſſary qualitie to be in all wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Communicants. And therefore we are to make ſpeciall ſearch and triall of it.</p>

                     <p>VVEe may try our Faith; firſt by the ground, then by the ſubiect.</p>
                     <p>The ground of ture ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing faith, is the word of God manifeſted vnto our conſciences by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, to bee the Word of GOD. That Faith which reſteth vpon any other ground-work, or foundation, can bee no true ſauing Faith.</p>
                     <p>A good meanes to try whether our Faith be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed grounded vpon the Word of God, is; To
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:16822:64"/> examine our conſciences in theſe particulars.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Whether we beleeue indeed, and in truth, that the Writings of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apoſtles, in the Old and New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are the very Word of God? (For the whole Word of God, ſo farre as is needful to be beleeued vnto ſaluation, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained therein) or at the leaſt, whether we be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly troubled and grieued in our ſoules, &amp; from our very hearts, when (throgh any temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation) we are moued to doubt of the ſame: And whether we vſe al means we can, to come to bee fully perſwaded thereof? For in ſuch caſes, God
<pb facs="tcp:16822:65"/> accepts the will and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour for the deed.<note place="margin">Mar. 9, 24 Rom. 7, 18 Matt. 5.6</note>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2 Whether we vnfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly deſire to be taught &amp; inſtructed in the Word of God, and to come to the true knowledge, and vnderſtanding, &amp; belief thereof? And whether we loue and affect thoſe meanes moſt, which are moſt powerful and effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall to that end and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe? For hee (whoſe Faith is grounded vpon Gods Word, hath his hope grounded vpon the ſame Word; euen all the hope that hee hath of euerlaſting life. And therefore he muſt needs deſire to bee acquainted therewith, by all meanes poſſible.</p>
                     <pb n="61" facs="tcp:16822:65"/>
                     <p n="3">3 VVhether our igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and dulneſſe, in vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the word, and our forgetfulneſſe thereof, be grieuous and troubleſome vnto vs? For how can it chuſe but grieue &amp; trouble a man, when he knowes not, or vnderſtands not, or can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not remember, the Eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his owne euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting eſtate?</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Whether our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,<note place="margin">Pſ. 119, 92 97, 98, 103</note> or hearing the word read, or preached: our meditating, confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and ſtudie of it, doe increaſe, or nouriſh our loue and delight, and beliefe in it? or if wee cannot diſcerne any ſuch matter, whether wee be not vnfainedly grieued
<pb facs="tcp:16822:66"/> and humbled for it.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 VVhether wee giue credit and authoritie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, aboue all humane Traditions,<note place="margin">Pſ. 119, 113</note> &amp; Cuſtomes whatſoeuer? And whe-we doe not deny credit and beliefe vnto what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer wee know to bee repugnant vnto the ſame word?</p>
                     <p n="6">6 Whether we finde a lightneſſe, and cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in our conſciences, when we haue done any thing agreeable vnto the Word of God? And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wee finde a trouble, or a dulneſſe and heaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the ſame, when we haue done any thing, which we know to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant vnto the ſame Word?</p>

                     <p n="7">7 VVhether wee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fainedly hope in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, feare the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, deſire the bleſſings, &amp; indeuour to auoid the curſes contained in this Word, and whether we equally beleeue the one, as well as the other?</p>
                     <p n="8">8 VVhether we iudge it a ſingular bleſſing of the Lord, that he hath in this manner reuealed his will in the written Word; &amp; that he vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafeth vs libertie and meanes to come to the knowledge, vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and beliefe of it? And whether wee iudge it to bee, a great iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment &amp; curſe vpon them, from whom this Word is hid, and who want this
<pb facs="tcp:16822:67"/> liberty and meanes that we enioy.</p>
                     <p n="9">9 Laſtly, whether we can proue, thoſe points of Religion and Faith, which wee hold and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, by the written Word of GOD?

And whether we miſdoubt, &amp; ſuſpect all thoſe points of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that we cannot ſee warranted by the Word of God?</p>
                     <p>If we can finde theſe properties in our ſoules, then haue wee found in our ſelues, ſo many infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible ſignes and tokens, that our Faith hath a

                     <p>SEcondly, wee are to try and examine our Faith in Chriſt, whether it bee true and liuely, no or yea, by the obiect and matter thereof.</p>
                     <p>The obiect and matter of true Faith, is, That di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine truth, which God in his Word hath reuealed vnto vs. For if the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of GOD in his Word, be the ground of our Faith; then that truth (which is reuealed in the Word) muſt needes bee the obiect and matter
<pb facs="tcp:16822:68"/> therof. Now foraſmuch, as there was neuer any one man, that could euer atttaine vnto the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of all &amp; euery par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular truth, reuealed in the word of God: the readieſt meanes heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to try our Faith, is, by ſuch maine funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall truths therein contained, and plainely taught, vpon which all other truths doe in ſome ſort depend, and vnto which they are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. And therefore let vs examine our conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in theſe points.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 VVhether doe wee vnfainedly beleeue the the Myſterie of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, the Creation of the world, the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi>

                     <p>Doth not experience teach vs, That ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons haue made great ſhewes of pietie, and more then an ordinary profeſſion thereof, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that they haue ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, not only to others, (but out of doubt, euen to themſelues) to burne in zeale, to ſome ſpeciall Truths, and cauſes of

                     <p>This trial of our ſelues, doth not exclude the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all which others (as farre as they are able) are to make of vs, eſpecially our Gouernours, Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,

                     <p>But the truth is, ſuch perſons as are not willing that others ſhould exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine them, do neuer pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to examine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues; but are guiltie to themſelues of Ignorance and Graceleſneſſe, and affect the ſame: And therefore had rather liue and rot therein, then diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer it to others, thogh they might haue helpe thereby.

                     <p>Here wee may note by the way, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle doth not onely tie, the duty of Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the receiuing of this Sacrament; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the receiuing of this Sacrament, to the dutie of Examination: Not that we ſhould neuer ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine our ſelues, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the receiuing of this Sacrament, or vpon this occaſion onely; but that doing it vpon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, wee ſhould then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the doing of it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, &amp; not forſake the Table of the Lord.

                     <p>The curſe propunded is this; That a man, not trying and examining himſelfe, eateth and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vnworthily, and

                     <p>Surely, if vpon our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy receiuing, our bowels and entrailes ſhould bee in danger to rot within vs; yet, if no more euil then that ſhold follow, it were nothing ſo fearefull a matter as this is, to eat and drinke our owne damnation.

                     <p>Theſe iudgements were bodily afflictions, of diuers ſorts and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.

                     <p>Hence we learne,</p>
                     <p n="1">1 That we ought in a ſpeciall manner, to reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:16822:93"/> and religiouſly vſe thoſe ordinances of God, the profanation wherof, hee markes and brands with particular viſible iudgements. Gods meere threatnings of death af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this life, ſhould bee enough to terrifie Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, from the abuſe of any of his ordinances: Much more then ſhould they moue vs, when (as ſo many ſeales &amp; Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments thereof) hee ſhall annex thereunto ſenſible plagues &amp; puniſhments in this life. We ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not but ſee, that many plagues &amp; iudgements are gone forth, from the Throne of God into the world; yea; into the Church; yea, into many of our houſes,
<pb facs="tcp:16822:94"/> and vpon our owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: Neither doe we ſee the iudgements only, but we might ſee alſo (if wee did not wilfully ſhut our eyes) for what particular ſins GOD infflicteth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them. Who is it that cannot ſee, that ſo many &amp; ſo many plagues and vengeances haue fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, and doe yet lie vpon ſuch and ſuch men, for their murthers, thefts, adulteries, treaſons, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries, drunkenneſſe, &amp;c. And yet neither the ſight of theſe iudgements, no nor the ſenſe and feeling of ſome of them in our owne perſons, will ſerue to reſtrain vs from thoſe ſinnes; But in the midſt of ſo many iudgements
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:16822:94"/> theſe ſinnes abound, and as it were triumph ouer them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 We may learne, that the vnworthy &amp; profane receiuers of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, doe not onely eat and drinke therein a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual iudgement (which hypocrites and carnall men do not ſo much care for;) but euen bodily iudgements alſo, ſo that it may proue in the end &amp; effect no bette, rthen a very bane &amp; poyſon vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our bodies, &amp; a means of many grieuousiſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, yea and of vntimely death. For ſo it proued (we ſee) to ſome of theſe Corinthians; and we can pleade no ſpeciall pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge. The more there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:16822:95"/> that wee may loue our bodily liues &amp; health the more; let vs make conſcience of the former duties. Theſe kind of iudgements here menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, are no ſtrangers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt vs; yea the hand of God in this kind hath lien a long time heauy vpon vs; and though we cannot preciſely ſay (as the Apoſtle heere doth,) That for this very cauſe, ſome of vs are afflicted, with this diſeaſe &amp; ſome with that, and ſo many with the peſtilence, &amp;c. yet hauing ſuch a preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſet before vs, in the Word of God, of ſuch a ſin, puniſhed with ſuch iudgements, it being too apparant, that not onely
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:16822:95"/> the ſame ſin doth raigne amongſt vs, but that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the ſame iudgements lie in great weight and meaſure vpon vs; wee haue iuſt cauſe to feare, that amongſt others, this very ſinne is one cauſe thereof. And therefore, in ſeeking to remoue theſe iudgements, let vs haue a ſpeciall care a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt other ſinnes to reforme this.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 So oft as any of vs are guiltie vnto our ſelues, of vnreuerent and vnworthy receiuing of this Sacrament, and the more free we haue been withall, from any of theſe iudgements, in the greater danger we ſhold feare our ſelues to bee.
<pb facs="tcp:16822:96"/> For wee are indebted, ſo many deaths and ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes to the Lord, which (except wee preuent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with true Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance) we ſhall be ſure to pay, with the intereſt, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this life, or in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. For the Lord as much hates this ſinne in vs, as in the Corinthians, and will be ſure at ſome time or other, by one meanes or other, to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh it ſeuerely; And the more hee deferres to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh it, the more ſeuerely he will doe it, when hee takes the rod once into his hands. Let vs then in the feare of God take heed, how in this caſe wee too much abuſe the patience and long ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:16822:96"/> of God; patience wounded becomes fury.</p>
                     <p>For the further infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of this, the Apoſtle ſhewes,</p>

                     <p>His Iuſtice, in that he had not thus ſharpely iudged them, if they had iudged themſelues. <hi>For</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>if wee would iudge our ſelues, we ſhould not be iudged, v.</hi> 31. As though hee ſhould ſay: Wee may thanke our ſelues for theſe and ſuch like iudgements that lie vpon vs, and can no way blame God for them. For it is iuſt with him, the beſt of vs being ſo ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full as we are, that when
<pb facs="tcp:16822:97"/> wee will not iudge and condemne our ſelues, we ſhould be in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner iudged and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by him.</p>
                     <p>Hence we may learne,</p>
                     <p n="1">1 That the beſt means to preuent any iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, whether temporall or eternall, is, to accuſe, arraigne, iudge &amp; condemne our ſelues: and contrarily, the ſureſt way to pull downe all ſorts of iudgements vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our ſelues, is to iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie our ſelues, and to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the merits of our owne righteouſneſſe.</p>
                     <p>Would wee then in moſt effectuall manner, preuent ſickneſſe, ſhame, death? Let vs examine our ſelues, and ſearch
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:16822:97"/> what ſinnes are in vs, and paſſe the ſeuereſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of condemnation againſt our ſelues that may be. The more (if it be done vnfainedly) wee ſhal condemn our ſelues, the more the Lord will iuſtifie vs.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 The due triall and examination of a mans ſelfe, and the iudging &amp; condemning of a mans ſelfe, doe one neceſſarily follow vpon another. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe there is no good coherence of theſe words with the former.</p>
                     <p>He the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that ſhal carefully &amp; conſcionably examine himſelfe, ſhall be ſure to finde matter enough in himſelfe, to iudge and condemne himſelfe for.
<pb facs="tcp:16822:98"/> So that hee doth moſt worthily eat and drinke this Sacrament, that ſhall diſcerne in himſelfe moſt matter of iudgement &amp; condemnation: and none more vnworthy recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers thereof, then thoſe which can finde nothing in themſelues to iudge &amp; condemne themſelues for.</p>
                     <p>Hee ſhewes ſecondly, the Mercy of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them herein. That theſe iudgements (vnto them that can make right vſe of them) are but fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly and louing cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſements and inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to keepe them from the common condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world. <hi>But</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>whilſt wee are
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:16822:98"/> iudged, wee are chaſtened</hi> (or nurtured and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted) <hi>of the Lord, becauſe wee ſhould not be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the world.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As if hee ſhould haue ſaid: You are notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to behold Gods mercie towards you, ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in this Iuſtice of his. For he doth not this out of any hatred hee beares to any of you, that are humbled vnder this hand of his, &amp; can make a good vſe thereof. But as a louing and deare fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chaſteneth and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteth his childe, when he ſees him in any fault, not that hee might bee auenged of him, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thereby to terrifie him and keepe him from ſuch
<pb facs="tcp:16822:99"/> courſes, as might bring him to the gibbet, or gallowes, or any other ſuch ſhamefull end: So God exerciſeth you with theſe temporall chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that thereby hee might keep, and reſtrain you from following ſuch courſes, as might bring you (with the reſt of the wicked world) to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall damnation.</p>
                     <p>The conſideration here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, ſhould not embolden vs to be the leſſe carefull of the former duties, but rather to make more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of them. For howſoeuer thoſe who receiue this Sacrament vnworthily, doe not ſo eat and drinke their own damnation, that there is

                  <p>GOod Reader, after I had yeelded to the publiſhing of mine owne poore me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations vpon 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23. there came to my hands in writing, this enſuing Treatiſe, written ſome yeeres ſince by a godly and faithfull Paſtor, for the direction of his owne people, in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy receiuing of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, at what time hee was firſt called vnto them.</p>
                  <p>In the peruſall whereof, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in my ſelfe well perſwaded of the fulneſſe and perſpicuity of that doctrine of preparation, which it propoundeth to intreat of, the orderly method of euery part thereof, the plaine and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
<pb facs="tcp:16822:116"/> handling of the matter, &amp; that it did ſupply many need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full points of inſtruction that are wanting in mine owne Treatiſe; I was earneſt with the Author to giue me leaue to publiſh the ſame, and to adioyne it as an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament and helpe vnto mine: which with much impportunitie at length I haue obtained.</p>
                  <p>For the ſpirituall good that thou ſhalt receiue thereby, bleſſe the Lord; and pray for the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, that God would reſtore him again, to that former liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in his Church, which heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore to the glory of God, and the comfort of many a Chriſtian ſoule, he hath enioyed.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, the reaſon why the Lord ſo ſpeaks of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, is to ſhew how certain and neere that ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall preſence and vnion is, that by the power of his ſpirit is made between
